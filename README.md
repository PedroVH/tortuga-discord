# Tortuga Discord
A discord music bot, with some extra features! The aim of this project is to bring an all-in-one discord bot, 
that fits all my needs.

### Requirements
* A discord application
* Java 17

# How to Use
First, you need to create a discord bot. There are plenty of resources on how to do that, but to summarise, head to 
[the discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application. 
You should give this bot **admin** permissions when inviting him to a server. While you're there, save the 
**discord token** for later.

Download the `tortuga-discord.jar` from the latest release and define an environment variable called `DISCORD_TOKEN`, 
with your **discord token** as the value. And lastly, after making sure you have 
[installed java JDK 17](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/install/installation-jdk-microsoft-windows-platforms.html) 
correctly, open up a terminal and run `java -jar tortuga-discord.jar`.
